# Naive Bayes Classifier: Iris Dataset Testing

This repository contains the implementation and testing of a **Naive Bayes Classifier** model on the popular **Iris Dataset**, a staple in machine learning. The primary goal of this project is to quickly demonstrate the performance of this fundamental classification algorithm on a standard dataset.
